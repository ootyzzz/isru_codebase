# Research on Flexible Deployment Strategies for ISRU Oxygen Production Systems

## Abstract

This paper investigates the flexible deployment strategy problem for lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) oxygen production systems. By constructing a multi-stage flexible deployment optimization model under stochastic demand, we analyze the performance of three different flexible deployment strategies. The study employs a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to characterize demand uncertainty, establishes theoretical optimal solutions under complete information as performance upper bounds, and designs three practical flexible deployment strategies: conservative, aggressive, and moderate. Simulation results show...
